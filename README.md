<!-- ### Hi there 👋 -->
👋🏽 Hi, my name is Waqar.

🎓 Western University graduate with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. (Spring 2021)

🌇 Pakistani/Canadian, with a passion for coding and developing products that will bring value to others

📚 In terms of experience, at my 16-month internship, I was responsible for maintaining and developing high-quality tools using Javascript, React, and Node.js for department use. After a few months, I became the go-to guy for the company's Grafana system and was responsible for maintaining and improving it. This experience taught me a great deal about software development and data analysis. 

💬 Outside of work, I've worked on a couple of fun side projects over the years, which I'm always happy to talk about with people.

💻 As for my future, I hope to one day work as a software developer at a company where my work has an impact and will bring value to other people, and at the same time, I would love to work with a diverse and fun team.

🏔 In my free time, you can find me watching fun sitcoms, listening to music, and learning new skills.

🌱 Frontend Development (JavaScript, React), Backend Development (Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL), Machine Learning (Python)

💼 I'm interested in full-stack web development opportunities where I can put my skills and experiences to practical use and continue to be challenged and grow as a software developer.
