I have over 4 years of experience in software development and currently work as a Software Engineer at CARFAX. I’m part of a talented team of five, building and maintaining features for the Car Care web app, which serves over 30 million users. I'm passionate about creating impactful products that people trust and that make a positive difference in the world.

Before joining CARFAX, I worked as a Game Analyst Intern at Big Blue Bubble. There, I developed data-driven dashboards using tools like Grafana and AWS Redshift, and built internal tools using JavaScript and React to improve product functionality.

Outside of work, I love traveling and reading. I’ve visited 9 countries and 4 continents so far, and I’m always looking for new places to explore. 

I also enjoy meeting new people and having interesting conversations over coffee. Feel free to reach out to me at waqarbinkalim[at]gmail[dot]com to connect!
